page.codeOfConduct.title=Conf Code of Conduct
page.codeOfConduct.description=Fundamentals to follow if you attend Mix-IT
page.codeOfConduct.content=You attendees were awesome on previous years, and we hope that this year will be the same, without any incident. \
                           However, we have seen in other conferences that a slip can always happen. \
                           We then decided to have a Code of Conduct to ensure that our communities stay a friendly \
                           place for any attendee, no matter their origin, gender, age or sexual preferences.<br/>\
                           Enjoy those two days and keep making Mix-IT the conference we enjoy. \
                           Those guidelines seem obvious to us, and should be applied in this conference \
                           or in every day life without having to remind them.

cfp.quality.title=How to make a great session

              You'll have plenty of time to refine it, but keep in mind that your submission has to appeal to both organization team \
