        ## Profile description : (long) Markdown sample

        ### Overview

        Great features of Markdown are:

        * It's plain text (e.g., support for version control, create with code)  
        * It's simple to learn and use
        * The source is highly readable (much more so than HTML or LaTeX; and arguably more so than other markup languages)
        * It's quicker to type than HTML 
        * It's easy to convert to other formats
        * Several websites such as Stack Exchange and Github use it
        * HTML code can be interspersed when features such as tables are not supported 

        It's not for everything, but it's a good tool for certain tasks.
        I'm still exploring the options, but in the case of blog posts and readme files it works well.


        ### Learning the Syntax
        The markup is simple to learn.
        I first installed the Markdown Editor in Eclipse  
        and associated `.md` files with the Markdown editor.

        I then:

        1. created a file called `test.md` and opened it in the Markdown editor in Eclipse
        2. opened the Markdown HTML Preview: 
        `Window -- Show View -- Other -- Markdown -- Markdown HTML Preview`
        3. worked through the [Markdown syntax guide][msg]
        creating simple proof of concept examples, bouncing between
        the Markdown Editor and the Markdown HTML Preview.

        [msg]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax


        ### Conversion
        #### Markdown to HTML
        Using the Eclipse Markdown plugin, a HTML version of the Markdown file
        can be obtained in several ways.

        * Right click the Markdown HTML Preview and click "View Source"
        * When in the Markdown editor, go to File -- Export HTML. 
        This creates a HTML version of the file

        # Session description : Markdown sample
        I've recently adopted Markdown as a markup language for editing my blog posts.
        This post discusses 
        (a) the benefits of Markdown,
        (b) installing a Markdown editor,
        (c) learning Markdown, and
        (d) converting between formats.

        I'm still exploring the options, but in the case of blog posts and readme files it works well.


        ### Installation
        I chose to install the Markdown Editor plugin for Eclipse developed by Daniel Winterstein. 
        Cool features include:

        * Outline View
        * Syntax highlighting
        * Markdown HTML Preview
        * Integration with Eclipse

        Installation instructions can be found on the [winterwell] website.

        #### Other options
        [Pandoc] appears to be a good option for converting between document 
        formats such as Markdown, LaTeX, RTF, PDF, OpenDocument, and more.
